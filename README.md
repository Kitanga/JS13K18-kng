# My JS13K 2018 Edition Submission

This was put together in under 2 days, so please view it with that in mind. Anyway, this is an endless game in which you have to manally allow or block IP packets. Why? Well because you live in a country that has tightly controlled internet access and someone accidentally killed the servers. It's going to be a while before the servers are back online, so get comfy, grab a cup of tea, and block away.
